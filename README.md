Fake Store is a fully functional e-commerce website developed for portfolio purposes, showcasing various features such as authentication, cart functionality, and checkout. All product data is sourced from the fakestoreapi.com API. The website is built using Next.js, a React framework, and is deployed using Vercel.

## Features

1. Authentication: Fake Store incorporates authentication functionality using NextAuth, a popular authentication library for Next.js applications. Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely.

2. Cart Functionality: The website allows users to add products to their cart, view the cart contents, update quantities, and remove items from the cart. The cart state is managed using Redux, a state management library.

3. Checkout and Payments: Fake Store integrates with Stripe, a widely used payment processing platform. Users can proceed to checkout, enter their credit card details, and complete the payment process. For testing purposes, you can use the following credit card credentials: "4242424242424242 4/42 424".

4. Styling: The website utilizes Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable CSS framework, for its styling needs. Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of utility classes, allowing for rapid and consistent styling development.

5. Database: Fake Store employs Firebase, a real-time database platform, for storing user-related information and cart data. Firebase offers a scalable and secure solution for data storage and retrieval.

6. Notifications: React-Hot-Toast, a lightweight and customizable toast notification library, is integrated into Fake Store. Users receive informative and visually appealing notifications for actions such as adding items to the cart or completing a purchase.

7. Icons: Fake Store utilizes HeroIcons, a set of free SVG icons designed for web projects. These icons enhance the visual appeal and provide intuitive representations for various elements and actions throughout the website.

8. API Handling: Axios, a popular HTTP client library, is used for handling API requests in Fake Store. It simplifies the process of sending requests to the fakestoreapi.com API and retrieving the necessary product data.

9. Date/Currency Formatting: Fake Store leverages react-currency-formatter and moment libraries to format dates and currencies. These libraries ensure consistent and localized formatting of dates and currency values.
